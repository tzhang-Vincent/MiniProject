Norway locates in the northern part of Europe and it snows for about 5 months per year. We climbed mountain there and participated in the skiing activities. I don't like to stay in such a cold place for a long time although the scenes there are very impressive. When I took photos at the viewing platform on a high mountain, I felt too cold to firmly grasp my camera. It is a good place to travel but not a good place to live in.
