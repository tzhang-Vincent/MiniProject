It took me almost 12 hours driving to the Los Angeles. I fell asleep quickly in my bed since I was truely worn out. The breakfast in the hotel was great and I took a walk along the Hollywood Boulevard in the next morning. The air in LA is fresh and I like the people there also. The city is prosperous and the guide there is friendly. He guided to visit the Disneyland and Universal Studios which are really exciting places for vacation.
