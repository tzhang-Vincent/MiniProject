['To bring Iceland week to a close - I thought this shot summed the whole trip up beautifully. Still the best view in my eyes ❤️it’s back to the studio now for me. I have some big orchestral recording sessions in the next few weeks. The studio is flat out. Good times ahead. 🇮🇸 https://t.co/gHMdfh1Ssx']
