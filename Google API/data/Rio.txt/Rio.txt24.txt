['ðŸ—£ Rio Ferdinand on Hazard \n\n"I\'m fearful for him that he\'s gone there at the wrong time. \n\n"This is a team that\'s ageing, they\'re not on their way up, they\'ve not got much spark about them at the moment. That is going to affect him and reflect badly on him in the long term." https://t.co/30NTVUjl7I']
