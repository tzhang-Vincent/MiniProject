['Thank you Seattle! You welcomed in a kid from Ohio with open arms and showed nothing but the best support from day 1. It’s been an honor to wear the blue and green the last few years. No feelings but love and gratitude for the Seahawk organization and the city of Seattle! 🙏🏼 https://t.co/VCyEt554mh']
