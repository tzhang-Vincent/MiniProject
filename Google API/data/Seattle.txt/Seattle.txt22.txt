['.@ewarren camp says at least 20,000 people attended her rally in Washington Square Park tonight. \n\n(They got 23K rsvps, an aide says, and stopped counting attendees at 20K once Warren began speaking.)\n\nThis is her biggest event yet, following a Seattle rally that drew 15,000. https://t.co/Exj6CsxKlA']
