['#RajendraChola was the greatest NavalEmperor of world.Yet so humble that he never had his big statues erected.The one we see is  being blessed by Shiva at His feet. Eyes never feel tired seeing this sculpture again&amp; again.Can we hv a #RajendraCholaMarg and his statue in #Delhi? https://t.co/wruMSoayD3']
