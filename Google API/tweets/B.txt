After almost three years, it's time for this Frugal Traveler to hit the road. I've truly enjoyed doing this column, and I want to thank you for reading. If you're interested, you can follow me on my personal account @lucaspeterson or on Instagram at staletwizzlers. Safe travels!

@nhfruchter if you thought that was confusing, the board now shows two flight 5822s, leaving at the same time, at different gates. *kisses fingers* https://t.co/zaxqa5J4Tc
I've begun deep breathing exercises and visualizing getting onto a working airplane. You will not break me, @united!! You will ... not ... break ... me.
confusingly, this is what's currently shown at my gate. Two Flight 5822s leaving today. The one on the right is my original flight, and it oddly says on time? Meanwhile, the flight on the left, which I was just rebooked on, is, wait for it, DELAYED. https://t.co/cch5jP0ifV
@andrewlschwab I received a hotel voucher for last night -- this was the airline's fault (mechanical) and not a weather delay.
I've now been rebooked on a 1:25 pm flight, which will make a nice, round 24 hours from when I was originally supposed to leave. I literally could have driven to L.A. and back in that time. I was telling someone the other day I have inordinately good luck with flights. Whoops!
Update! 21 hours, or 1,260 minutes for you math fans out there, into my @united flight delay and ... they're *now* cancelling the flight! I live in Albuquerque now. Tell my mother I love her.
RT @nytimestravel: Our @FrugalTraveler finds that Long Beach offers much more than its name indicates. https://t.co/BCXPFQv8oc
For any other expenses, I will file a trip delay claim benefit with the @Chase card I used to book the trip, which allows reimbursement up to $500 for delays longer than 6 hours. And hopefully, my flight will actually leave tomorrow!!
However, even though there's no legal requirement, that's not always good business practice. Credit where it's due: I stood in line and eventually spoke to a @united rep, Nicholas, who gave me a hotel voucher and three $20 in-airport meal vouchers.
The crazy thing about U.S. airlines is that they're not required to give you anything -- anything at all -- if a flight is delayed or cancelled. https://t.co/UVFMksanOh
Hey @united, your policy is to put passengers up overnight when a flight is cancelled. What about delayed? What about this flight which has been "delayed" for almost a full 24 hours? https://t.co/bgdPzaEjqw
Lol https://t.co/WBIqJpd4U9
Did I say a 8.5 hour delay? Make that a TWENTY TWO AND A HALF HOUR DELAY https://t.co/y2fXNPWJIA
